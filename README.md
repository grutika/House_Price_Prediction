# House_Price_Prediction

This project is focused on predicting California house prices using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset contains different housing features such as average rooms, population, income, and other factors that influence the price of houses. I used the Linear Regression model to train the data and then tested it to check how accurately it can predict house prices. The project follows a step-by-step process including data exploration, feature selection, model training, testing, and evaluation. To measure the modelâ€™s performance, I calculated error metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

The purpose of this project is to understand how regression models can be applied to real-world problems such as predicting property prices. It also gives practice in handling datasets, training and testing models, and analyzing results. The project was implemented in Python using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
